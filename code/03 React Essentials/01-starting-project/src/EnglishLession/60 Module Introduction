In the previous course section,

we explored some important React essentials.

In this course section here,

we are going to take a closer look

at these Essential concepts and we'll dive a bit deeper.

For example, we'll take a closer look at JSX

and how we could replace it with non-JSX code.

We'll take another look at Components and State

and how we can structure our Component tree

and our project more efficiently.

We'll take a look at certain advanced concepts

including some advanced state usage concepts.

And we'll also dive into important patterns

and best practices.

And to explore all these things, we'll first get started

with that same demo application we built

in the last course section and we'll improve that project

and the code base of that project a little bit

before we then, later in this course section, also dive

into a brand new project where we build the game tic-tac-toe

with React and where we'll use this game

to explore some advanced concepts.
